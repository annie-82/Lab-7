#Problem number 1 - A function areaOfCircle(r) which returns the area of a circle of radius



def areaOfCircle(r):
    from math import pi #this will get the value of pi from math module. <= BETTER TO TAKE OUT FROM FUNCTION
    return pi * r * r #This returns the area of circle which is calculated as pi times r squared
print(areaOfCircle(1)) #This prints the areaofcircle
